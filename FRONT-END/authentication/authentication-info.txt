export class AuthenticationServiceService implements OnInit { ... }
Declares a TypeScript class named AuthenticationServiceService which implements the OnInit interface. This interface requires the implementation of the ngOnInit() lifecycle hook.
constructor(private http: HttpClient, private router: Router, private routes: ActivatedRoute) { ... }
Constructor for AuthenticationServiceService that injects Angular services:
HttpClient: Allows making HTTP requests.
Router: Allows navigation between different routes in the application.
ActivatedRoute: Provides access to information about the currently activated route.
ngOnInit():

Lifecycle hook called when Angular initializes the component.
Invokes this.canActivate() method, presumably to check if the authentication is active or to perform some initial setup.
executeAuthentication(username, password):

Method to authenticate the user by sending a POST request to ${this.base}/login endpoint with provided username and password.
Uses Angular's HttpClient to make the HTTP POST request.
Returns an Observable<any> that emits the server's response.
Uses pipe() and map() operators from RxJS to process the response:
Stores the received JWT token in sessionStorage prefixed with "Bearer".
Stores response.id in sessionStorage.
Returns the entire response object.
getToken():

Retrieves the JWT token stored in sessionStorage under the key 'token'.
Returns an empty string ("") if the token is not found.
decodeToken():

Uses the jwtDecode function (presumably from a library like jwt-decode) to decode the JWT token retrieved using this.getToken().
Returns the decoded token data.
