The CanActivate function is a route guard that ensures a user is authenticated
before allowing access to certain routes. It checks for the presence of
an authentication token using the AuthenticationServiceService.

If the token is present, it grants access by returning true;
if not, it redirects the user to the login page and returns false.

This function ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes in the application.
