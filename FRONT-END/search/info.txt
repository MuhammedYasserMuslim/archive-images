This code defines an Angular component (`SearchComponent`) with a mechanism to emit events (`searchTextChange`) whenever `enterSearchValue` changes.

Typically, this component might be used in a parent component's template. The parent component can then listen for the `searchTextChange` event emitted by `SearchComponent` and react accordingly (e.g., updating search results based on the entered search value).
