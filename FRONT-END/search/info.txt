The SearchComponent class is designed to capture search input from the user and
notify parent components about changes to the search text.
It has a property enterSearchValue to store the current search input and an EventEmitter searchTextChange to emit events whenever the search text changes.
The method onsearchTextChange is used to emit the current search value, allowing other components to react to the changes in the search input.
