That’s all. The Spring Data Repository will auto-generate the implementation based on the name we provided it.


Beyond all the very useful advantages of these repositories, there are some basic downsides of directly depending on these as well:

We couple our code to the library and to its specific abstractions, such as Page or Pageable; that’s, of course, not unique to this library – but we do have to be careful not to expose these internal implementation details
By extending, e.g. CrudRepository, we expose a complete set of persistence methods at once. This is probably fine in most circumstances as well, but we might run into situations where we’d like to gain more fine-grained control over the methods exposed, e.g. to create a ReadOnlyRepository that doesn’t include the save(…) and delete(…) methods of CrudRepository
