Entities in JPA are nothing but POJOs representing data that can be persisted in the database. An entity represents a table stored in a database. Every instance of an entity represents a row in the table.

Each JPA entity must have a primary key that uniquely identifies it. The @Id annotation defines the primary key. We can generate the identifiers in different ways, which are specified by the @GeneratedValue annotation.

In most cases, the name of the table in the database and the name of the entity wonâ€™t be the same.

In these cases, we can specify the table name using the @Table annotation:

Just like the @Table annotation, we can use the @Column annotation to mention the details of a column in the table.

The @Column annotation has many elements such as name, length, nullable, and unique:

Sometimes, we may want to persist a Java enum type.

We can use the @Enumerated annotation to specify whether the enum should be persisted by name or by ordinal (default)
